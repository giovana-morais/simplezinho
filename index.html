	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>I made this theme because I wanted a minimalist website but also not *that*
	minimalist. I hope you can also enjoy. It is very simple and has a lot of room
	for improvement because I am not very good at design or front-end. This is
	mostly for myself, so I'll update it to meet my needs.
	</p>

	<p>I am a PhD Candidate at New York University, supervised by Magdalena
	Fuentes. I am interested in multimodal models (audio-vision, audio-text),
	explainability techniques and music information retrieval. I like to think
	about Deep Learning from a data-centric perspective, investigating how biased
	datasets can affect model behavior and how we can explain model output.
